        <h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
        <p><strong>Are you legit?</strong></p>
        <p>The short answer is duh. The long and formal answer is yes, definitely so; you can read more on our about page and also take a look at our customer testimonials and feedback! </p>

        <p><strong>You don't actually hurt people, right?</strong></p>
        <p>Does it look like we want to get sued? No way. However, there are some inevitable natural disasters that could result in a re: target unfortunately sleeping with the fishes so just to be clear, we are not responsible for any accidental injuries or damages to property if it's your target's fault (aka your target gets so mad that he's been pranked and punches a wall or something). You can read more about this on our about page.</p>

        <p><strong>Is my target's address and other info confidential?</strong></p>
        <p>Yup. Our employees are under a strict confidentiality contract so even if you order a house prank, they'll simply go over to the address, do the prank, and then go home. Mailmen and pizza delivery guys tend to know your address too, and you usually trust them. So that's good reason to trust us as well. Don't worry - it'll be on us if any problems arise.</p>

        <h3>The Prank</h3>
        <p>We’ll set up an extremely realistic crime scene at your target’s house, complete with yellow danger tape, cops pretending to collect evidence around the house, and bystanders crowding around and watching! We’ll dress our employees as cops and bystanders, but if real bystanders end up coming to watch - hey, it’s a free country! Your target will come home to an extremely serious atmosphere and probably panic. If he or she asks any of our employees about the crime scene, they’ll play along accordingly. Ten minutes after your target arrives, we’ll pack everything up and leave without a word. Our videographers will subtly record everything that happens and you’ll have hilarious documentation of the once-in-a-lifetime prank! </p>

        <p><strong>“He thought they found his torrented movie collection!”</strong></p>
        <p>My friend brags about his torrented movie collection ALL the time. I mean, it’s great for when we hang out at his house, but it gets a little overboard sometimes. I wanted to get him back, and I realized the ultimate prank would be the crime scene one! He ended up thinking that the cops finally noticed how much he was torrenting and he started running away as soon as he saw the cops. He called me, and I think my laughter tipped him off. Best prank EVER.</p>

        <p><strong>"The look in her eyes…"</strong></p>
        <p>Purchased the crime scene prank, but was unable to be there when the actual prank happened. I ordered documentation beforehand, and I was amazed at how well the videographers captured the entire thing! It looked like a TV show; it was so realistic. I got to see some quality zoomed in shots of my coworker's petrified expression. Apparently she assumed the worst and actually thought someone died on her lawn, and totally freaked out. I don’t know if I’ll ever tell her that I was the one behind the prank!</p>

      <article> 
        <h3>The Prank</h3>
        <p>We round up around fifty or so of our best actors and send them off to run over to your target’s house screaming hysterically about an apocalypse. They’ll pound on the doors and walls and yell things like “Please let me in!” and “They’re coming!” It’s then up to your target whether or not they’ll actually let our employees in or not, but rest assure they’re under contract not to damage any of your target’s belongings! They’ll simply keep up the charade by hiding under various furniture pieces. Of course, they’ll have secret cameras attached so we can get hilarious footage of your target panicking. After ten or so minutes is up, our employees will stop what they’re doing and quietly leave - just like that.</p>

        <p><strong>“Neighbour drove away with his apocalypse gear!”</strong></p>
        <p>My neighbour is a bit on the crazy side and firmly believes that the apocalypse will happen in 2020. Because I’m a little evil, I thought why not speed things up and order the Apocalypse prank from you guys! Anyways, my crazy old neighbour ended up hopping in his car and driving outside of the city with all of his apocalypse gear stuffed in the back. I heard he drove for an hour before he realized nothing was happening!</p>

        <p><strong>"I've never seen my friend so scared!"</strong></p>
        <p>My friend is convinced that zombies exist. I purchased the "Apocalypse" package and I timed it so I was at his place as fifty people ran up to his house, pounded on the door, and yelled about zombies. He screamed and ran towards the cellar! I tried to act along but in the end I started laughing. He was totally impressed at how realistic the prank was!</p>

      <h2> Third Wheel Product Content </h2>
      <article> 
        <h3>The Prank</h3>
        <p>An hour before your target is due to come home, we gather up tables, seats, and plenty of romantic candles and set them up on your target’s lawn. We’ll then fill up the tables with around 15 different couples, and they’ll be acting like they’re on a romantic date. Your target will come home to 15 couples on the lawn, and our videographers will document the hilarity and awkwardness that will ensue. Will your target stand there awkwardly or threaten to call the cops? Whatever happens, don’t worry - we’ll be out of there with all our props within 10 minutes and our actors are prepared for any situation and will act accordingly! </p>

        <p><strong>“Forever alone”</strong></p>
        <p>My best friend, well, he’s been single for a long time and he’s been feeling down about it. So since I’m his best friend and all, I figured I had to be a d-bag and buy the Third Wheel prank for him. I hid in the bushes and watched the entire thing happen. It was PHENOMENAL. My friend got home, saw the couples, awkwardly shuffled up to one couple and asked why they were on his lawn. The couple replied that they were invited by one of their other friends for a couples’ get together! My friend blanked out, and kinda just sat on his driveway for a good minute, and then went inside and called ME! I didn’t pick up, of course, and he stayed inside until the couples packed up and left. I ran into his house and started laughing my ass off and explained the whole thing. He ended up cracking a grin at the end! </p>

        <p><strong>“He refused to talk to me for two days”</strong></p>
        <p>It was so worth it though. Got the Third Wheel package for my brother, who broke up with his girlfriend a week ago. I watched the video since I couldn’t be there for the prank, and my brother stormed up to one of the couples and started yelling and they put their hand on his shoulder and asked him to sit down. MY BROTHER STARTED TEARING UP and confided in the couple about his breakup feelings. Looks like I paid for an extra therapy session! But after I told him I was the one who pulled the prank, he ignored me for two days. I think he’s over it now, though, since he made me breakfast today.</p>

        <h3>New Prank</h3>
        <p>We’ve added a new prank - Third Wheel! This prank has the same central idea of the first two, Apocalypse and Crime Scene, with an added spice of awkwardness. Our co-owners actually came up with Third Wheel after a long and hilarious discussion at a local coffee shop about how they always end up third wheeling their friends. Funny story: Veronica always ends up sitting in the back of the car like a kid when she third wheels! She says it’s okay though, because she’s a kid at heart. We hope you like the new prank, and you’re always welcome to give us any suggestions by email or phone!</p>
