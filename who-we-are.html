						<h2>Our Goals</h2>
						<p>Let's be real here: pranks are fun at the expense of other people. There are some people out there who simply don't deserve being pranked because of their pure and kindhearted souls. We're here to help you prank those who, in your opinion, deserve to be pranked.</p>

						<h2>Our Team</h2>
						<p>The re: team is exactly what you think we are. I mean, who else but a bunch of bratty obnoxious people could set up a bratty obnoxious prank service? We take pride in our perpetual teenagehood and invite you all to join us.</p>

						<h2>Our Guarantees</h2>
						<p>Though we just completely slathered our name in the mud in the above paragraph, we still care about great customer service and confidentality. We guarantee that our employees will do exactly what is outlined on the product information, and no more than that. That means: no, we are not going to completely trash your target's house for no reason (unless that becomes a prank service sometime in the future) and no, we are not going to break into the house and steal everything. Come on, we're good people here! (kinda)</p>
