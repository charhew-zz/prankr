						<h2>What We Do</h2>
						<p> We’re a Canadian based company specialize in prank services that feature a large amount of people wrecking havoc at your target’s house. These pranks are not only hilarious and outlandish but they also cause no harm to the target and his or her surrounding environment! You pick the time, date, and location, make a payment, and at the specified time we’ll be there with our props, costumes, and people! Feel free to come watch the prank happen yourself, or if you are unable to make it, we’ll provide you with some sweet sweet documentation created by our resident photographers and videographers at a small fee.</p>

						<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
						<article>
							<p><strong>Are you legit?</strong></p>
							<p>The short answer is duh. The long and formal answer is yes, definitely so; you can read more on our about page and also take a look at our <a href="reviews.html" class="text-link">customer testimonials and feedback!</a></p>
						</article>

						<article>
							<p><strong>You don't actually hurt people, right?</strong></p>
							<p>Does it look like we want to get sued? No way. However, there are some inevitable natural disasters that could result in a re: target unfortunately sleeping with the fishes so just to be clear, we are not responsible for any accidental injuries or damages to property if it's your target's fault (aka your target gets so mad that he's been pranked and punches a wall or something). You can read more about this on our <a href="who-we-are.html" class="text-link">about</a> page.</p>
						</article>

						<article>
							<p><strong>Is my target's address and other info confidential?</strong></p>
							<p>Yup. Our employees are under a strict confidentiality contract so even if you order a house prank, they'll simply go over to the address, do the prank, and then go home. Mailmen and pizza delivery guys tend to know your address too, and you usually trust them. So that's good reason to trust us as well. Don't worry - it'll be on us if any problems arise.</p>
